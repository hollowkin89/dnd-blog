			<h1 class="wwh1">Dice!</h1>
			<p>While I do not have a massive dice collection, i still have more than the others in my dnd group, and everyone calls  me a dice goblin. i have 91 dice, that being 1 set of 11 dice, 11 sets of 7 dice, and 2 individual dice, one d4, one d20, and a d10. apologies in advance for how garbage the images are! i had terrible lighting for all these photos rip</p>

			<h2>The dice sets</h2>
			<hr>
			
			<h3>Transparent turquoise</h3>
			<img class="center" src="dice/turquoise.png">
			<p>this is one of the first sets i bought and i fricking love them. they kinda look edible i want to eat one.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Opaque White</h3>
			<img class="center" src="dice/w.png">
			<p>these are just white with black numbers. there isnt much to say here.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Radioactive green and transparent purple</h3>
			<img class="center" width="330" height="320" src="dice/2.jpg">
			<p>the green ones look like toxic waste. they look like hard candy even more than the turquoise ones. why.</p>
			<p>i lost the purple d4 so i bought a single d4. it isnt the same colour, but idc. it adds character. i consider it a part of that set now lol.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Translucent grey and black swirl</h3>
			<img class="center" src="dice/storm.png">
			<p>they look like glittery, swirly, storm clouds. they also have glow in the dark specks, but my phone camera is trash so i couldnt get a decent photo to add.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>marbled pink and black, glittery light blue</h3>
			<img class="center" width="300" height="370" src="dice/12.jpg">
			<p>I have two of these sets because the place i got them from was doing a deal where if you bought two D&D items you would get some free lizardfolk minis and they were super cheap so why not. these look awesome. the first set i bought other than the set that came with the starter kit</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>multicoloured metal dice, marbled pink and blue, marbled dark blue and light blue.</h3>
			<img class="center" width="400" height="550" src="dice/7.jpg">
			<p>I got the metal dice as a birthday gift from a friend of mine, and they're one of my favourite sets. because they have a bit of weight to them they are super satisfying to roll.</p>
			<p>even though it is difficult to see in the image, the lighter blue is slightly shiny for both the pink + blue and the lightblue + darkblue dice.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>red transparent</h3>
			<img class="center" src="dice/r.png">
			<p>these are the very first set i got, it came with the starter set. this is a set of 11, unlike the other sets of 7. not my favourite, but i have a little bit of sentimental attachment to them.</p>
